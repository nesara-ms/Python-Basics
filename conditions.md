🐍 Conditions in Python
In Python, conditions are statements that let your program make decisions — they check whether something is true or false and then perform actions based on that result.

💡 Example
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
Here:

if checks a condition → age >= 18
If the condition is True, it runs the first block (print("You are an adult."))
Otherwise (else), it runs the second block.
🧠 Common Conditional Statements in Python
Keyword	Meaning
if	Checks a condition
elif	Checks another condition if the previous one was false
else	Runs if none of the above conditions are true
Example:

marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Excellent")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Good")
else:
    print("Needs improvement")
⚙️ Comparison Operators (used in conditions)
Operator	Meaning	Example	Result
==	Equal to	5 == 5	True
!=	Not equal to	5 != 3	True
>	Greater than	10 > 3	True
<	Less than	2 < 5	True
>=	Greater than or equal to	7 >= 7	True
<=	Less than or equal to	4 <= 9	True
🔗 Combining Conditions
You can also combine conditions using:

and → both must be True
or → at least one must be True
not → reverses True/False
Example:

age = 20
has_id = True

if age >= 18 and has_id:
    print("You can vote.")
